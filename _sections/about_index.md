### Hallo! | नमस्ते!

I am a MSc. Physics (Hons.) student at the University of Cologne, Germany. My research interest lies in the field of Quantum Computation. Currently, I am working in the research group of [Prof. Tommasso Calarco][link:tc] at Jülich Forschungzentrum, Germany.

Before joining Cologne, I was working as a __Scientist__ at __Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO)__.
