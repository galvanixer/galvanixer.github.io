                <p class="lead">Sabbine Hossenfelder's Lost in Math is a critique on the current state of theoretical physics (particularly particle physics). From the prologue itself, she made her stance unambiguous and set the tone and pace of the book. Doctor Hossenfelder's claimed that the current leaders in the theoretical physics community have taken the subject far from the current reality of the world. To her, it sometimes feels like, practitioners are making a fictional world whose only validation is mathematical consistency. In this article, I plan to wade through the clutter of arguments put forth by Doctor Hossenfelder, and will critically analyze them from an impartial lens. Before delving deep into Sabbine's mind, I would like to put forward a warning for the potential reader. I am a student of Physics, who is more inclined towards its theoretical aspects, and hence possess a natural bias against her claim. With this warning, let me begin dissecting her arguments.</p>

<blockquote><p>If you start with a set of axioms, then whatever follow is the truth as long as it is mathematically consistent.</p></blockquote>

<p> As the title suggests, theoretical physicists today are lost in the web of mathematical arguments. There is no way they could have avoided this. Mathematics is the language of universe, and, as the book claims, ensures that even physicists cannot lie to themselves. Basically, if you start with a set of axioms, then whatever follow is the truth as long as it is mathematically consistent. The question remains whose truth, a mathematical one or a physical one. There lies the debate of mathematical consistency, because it only ensures that the result obtained is a mathematical truth, and hence may not be valid in the physical world we live in. According to author, experimental results are the only way to validate the mathematical truth. Some physicists may argue upon this, but overall the general consensus is that nothing vindicates a physical theory more than measurements. </p>

<blockquote><p>Beauty can be broken down into three ingredients: symmetry, elegance, and naturalness.</p></blockquote>

<p>After establishing the claim that mathematical consistency is necessary but not sufficient, Sabbine went further with her attack on the status quo. This time she directly attacked a vaguely defined term "beauty" which is oft used in the theoretical physics circle to approve or disapprove a new theory. In particle physics, beauty can be broken down into three ingredients: <b>symmetry, elegance, and naturalness.</b> Symmetry leads to simplicity, elegance and naturalness together makes the unification possible.</p>

<p> Physicist realized it long ago that symmetry has a deep role to play in the universe (of which we are a part). This has been mathematically translated by <b>Emmy Noether</b> in the form of a theorem stating that, <i>"Every symmetry leads to a conserved quantity."</i> To non-physicists this might sound a vague statement. Let me restate it, symmetry leads to redundancies, and hence simplicity. For example, one can describe a circle by stating positions of all the points making the circle. That would be infinite parameters. The same circle, by exploiting its symmetry (U(1) symmetry) can be described by just 2 variables- origin and radius. Basically, symmetry helps in reducing the number of parameters used to describe a system, and hence make the entire description more simplistic. The idea is to describe the system with as less parameters as possible but not lesser. Symmetry has always guided physicists and many of the physical laws including general relativity, strong nuclear force etc. have been derived on the edifice of symmetry arguments. Sometimes, in the hindsight physicist find symmetries lurking inside an already validated physical theory. Logical conclusion from the experience would be that many of the physical theories are symmetric, but that does not mean that all physical theories have to be symmetric. This is the argument that author has used extensively to attack the current forth runner Supersymmetry. </p>

<p> Supersymmetry states that for every fermionic particle there is a bosonic counterpart and vice versa. These counterparts are sometimes referred to as super partners in Physics literature. As of now, for some 25 odd particles in the standard model, Physicists believe that there exists super partners. They claimed that the energies used in Large Hadron Collider (LHC) would be able to produce such super partners. This claim largely relies on the naturalnessargument, which if true, clearly states that mass of super partners cannot be much different than that of Higgs Boson. Since Higgs Bosons were produced and detected by the LHC, the experts in the field concluded that other super partners should also be detected during the second phase (higher energy) of LHC. To their dismay, this prediction never came true. </p>

 <b>Flow of theories in abstract theory space</b>

</p>

<p> Naturalness states that dimensionless ratios between free parameteres or physical constants appearing in physical theory should take values of order 1. The major benefit that comes out of naturalness argument is that it avoids fine tuning, which indirectly helps in unification. To understand this, one needs to have the basic idea of resolution and emergent phenomena. It's an experimental fact, that short distance physics "decouples" from the physics at large distances. For example, properties of composite particles such as neutrons and protons are almost unaffected by the motion of their constituents, the quarks and gluons. Similarly, the orbits of planets don't depend on the planetary structure. Hence for every resolution, we have approximate theories known as Effective theories. Every level of resolution therefore has its own language. These resolution dependent objects and their properties are know as "emergent". Since theories depend on resolution, each one traces out a curve in theory space (abstract space in which theory resides) if the resolution changes. The curve of all theories together are referred to as the "flow of theories." Naturalness means that whatever we choose for the parameters of the more fundamental theory at high resolution, at low resolution the physics should resemble the one we observe. Hence, if we consider that Standard Model is a low resolution theory, and Theory of everything (to be discovered) is a high resolution theory, then naturalness claims that whatever be the parameters we start with for Theory of everything, we will always end up at Standard Model. Hence, in a round about manner Naturalness helps in unification. </p>

<blockquote><p>Current particle physics community has based their theories on imposition of symmetry and expectation of naturalness.</p></blockquote>

<p> Naturalness is an aesthetic criteria and has not been validated physically. In addition to this, the claims of naturalness have been experimentally invalidated as LHC (second phase) was not able to find the super partners. Sabine then concludes that the current particle physics community has based their theories on imposition of symmetry and expectation of naturalness. Hence, both of these arguments which are extensively used by physics community to consider or disregard a new theory are aesthetic ones, and are acting as impediments in our search for physical truth. Along with this, she has mainly relied on anecdotes and interviews of leading physicists to provide a complete picture of the status quo. Although, she has criticized the currennt research paradigms, but she is unable to provide the alternatives. My personal opinion is that like every natural science, physicists also require validation of their theories. During last century, the experiments used to provide this validation and the subsequent direction. But this is not possible now, as the time it takes to test a new fundamental law of nature can be longer than a scientist's full career. This has forced theorists to draw upon criteria other than empiricial adequacy to decide which research avenues to pursue. Aesthetic appeal or beauty is just one of them. </p>
