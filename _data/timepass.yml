  caption: An Unusual Instrument
  description: >-
                My 17-key Kalimba hardly covers two octaves, but gosh it's not
                an easy instrument. Unlike keyboard, I find that it is difficult
                to maintain Tempo with Kalimba. Perhaps, that's my inexperience 
                speaking. I'll update you once I am Fluent in this skill.

                It helps me calm my mind.

  caption: Language of the future
  description: >-
                Julia, I believe, is the language that is going to define scientific computing.
                The language has a lot to offer, and unlike other high level languages, Julia
                does not try to make things simpler more than they should be. With my limited
                experience, I have only realized that this is the language that fulfills most 
                of my needs.

                मेरी हमेशा से ही हिंदी कविताओं में रुचि रही है।
                विशेष रुप से, वीर रस से भरी कविताएँ। मुझे इन
                कविताओं को सुनना एवं पढ़ना पसंद है।
