  description: >-
                Once upon a time, in a secluded place, far from the 
                noise of the world, I was trying to classically simulate
                time evolution quantum operators. The Matrix realization
                of the operator depends upon the size of the quantum system. 
                Unfortunately, Quantum race of the 21st Century among the
                Tech Giants have increased the system size to be more than
                100 qubits. For us, this meant a Data Type that can store
                around 2<sup>100</sup> values. Hence, the search led to Judy Arrays.

- title: "Lost in Math?"
  description: >-
                Sometimes we do random things, and this book was read
                because 
                One semester I found myself comparatively free (वेल्ला). In order
                to utilize free time, I decided to take Philosophy for Physics course. Far from
                the equations, the course felt like a breath of fresh air. As part of this course,
                I happen to read <b> Lost in Math </b> by Sabbine Hossenfelder. This book is an
                excellent summary of the current status of particle physics. In this article,
                I have reviewed this book.

- title: "Guru Dakshina"
  description: >-
                Do you understand the concept of Gurudakshina? 
                It is an age old tradition which is the part of our 
                Guru-Shishya Parampara. In ancient India, children did not 
                have to pay for their education. 
                They lived in their teacher’s home for years as if they 
                were his own children. 
                When they completed their education, they might have to 
                give something as Gurudakshina. In this article, 
                we are going to discuss about various aspects of this 
                revered tradition, and how the revival of the same 
                can improve the overall education system in the country.
