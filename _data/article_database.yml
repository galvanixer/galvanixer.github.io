  description: >-
                Once upon a time, in a secluded place, far from the 
                noise of the world, I was trying to classicaly simulate
                time evolution quantum operators. The Matrix realization
                of the operator depends upon the size of the quantum system. 
                Unfortunately, Quantum race of the 21st Century among the
                Tech Giants have increased the system size to be more than
                100 qubits. For us, this meant a Data Type that can store
                around 2<sup>100</sup> values. Hence, the search led to Judy Arrays.
