                     Challenge, drudgery, and bliss - I think these three words describe the life I have lived. 
                     Every new opportunity begins with a challenge, when we explore new things, realize our potential
                     and turn it into reality. But after that challenging phase, lies a lot of drudgery. The phase when
                     we make things perfect. It's the phase where we give the maximum of efforts and achieve the least of 
                     results. The final phase is pure bliss. I still have to experience that. \n


                     I was in Ahmedabad, working as a Scientist at Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO). During my few 
                     years, 
                     Right now, I am working as a Quantum Information Physicist in the research group of Prof. T. Calarco
                     at Jülich Research Center, Germany. 

                     I am a Quantum Information Physicist in the research group of Prof. Dr. Tommasso Calarco at Jülich Forschungzentrum,
                     Germany. Currently, I am pursuing Masters in Physics (Hons.) at the University of Cologne
