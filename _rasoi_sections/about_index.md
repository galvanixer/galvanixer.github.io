### Hallo! | नमस्ते!

<b>Challenge, drudgery, and bliss</b> - I think these three words describe the life I have lived. 
Every new opportunity begins with a challenge, when we explore new things, realize our potential
and turn it into reality. But after that challenging phase, lies a lot of drudgery. The phase when
we make things perfect. It's the phase where we give the maximum of efforts and achieve the least of 
results. The final phase is pure bliss. 

I was in Ahmedabad, working as a <b>Scientist at Indian Space Research Organization</b> (ISRO). I consider that time as my formative years. There were challenging problems to be solved, and a lot of drudgery to reach there. ISRO taught me many lessons, the most important of which was to be specific about your research objectives and pursue them diligently. I left ISRO in 2018 to pursue further studies, and this time I knew I wanted to explore the field of <b>Quantum information and computing</b>.

With that in mind, I joined University of Cologne as a BCGS scholar for Masters in Physics (Hons.). At present, I am working in the research group of [Prof. Tommasso Calarco][link:tc] at Jülich Forschungzentrum, Germany. We are exploring time evolution of large, sparse quantum states.
